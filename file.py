# Create a solution that accepts an input identifying the name of a CSV file, for example,
# "input1.csv". Each file contains two rows of comma-separated values. Import the built-in
# module csv and use its open() function and reader() method to create a dictionary of key:value
# pairs for each row of comma-separated values in the specified file. Output the file contents as
# two dictionaries.

# The solution output should be in the format

# {key:value,key:value,key:value}
# {key:value,key:value,key:value}

# Sample Input/Output:
# If the file content is
# input1.csv

# then the expected output is
# {a:100,b:200,c:300}
# {bananas:1.85,steak:19.99,cookies:4.52}

# Alternatively, if the file content is
# input2.csv

# then the expected output is
# {d:400,e:500,f:600}
# {celery:2.81,milk:4.34,bread:5.63}
