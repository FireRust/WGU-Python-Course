# 🐍 WGU Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of Python programs built as part of my coursework at **Western Governors University (WGU)** for the **B.S. in Software Engineering** program. Each project here reflects a key concept or skill in Python — from basic syntax to file I/O, classes, algorithms, and more.

## 📚 About

This repository contains solutions and mini-projects I completed while progressing through my Python-related courses at WGU. They were designed to reinforce concepts such as:

- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if, loops)
- Functions and modularity
- File handling
- Error handling
- Classes and object-oriented programming
- Basic algorithms and data structures

🤓 Why This Exists
I created this repo to:

Track my personal learning progress

Showcase code quality and documentation habits

Help other WGU students with study inspiration (no cheating, y’all 😄)

Use it as a foundation for future software dev work
